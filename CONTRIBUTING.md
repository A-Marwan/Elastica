## Rules
* Changes are never pushed into master
* Pull requests are made to master
* We use the Forking Workflow. https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow

## Pull Requests
* Pull requests should be opened as early as possible as pull requests are also here for communication / discussing changes
