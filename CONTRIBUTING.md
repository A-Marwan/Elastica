Contributing
============
Help is very welcomed, but code contributions must be done in respect of [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md). More details on how to contribute and guidelines for [pull requests](http://elastica.io/contribute/pull-request.html) can be found [here](http://elastica.io/contribute/).

See [Coding guidelines](http://elastica.io/contribute/coding-guidelines.html) for tips on how to do so. All changes which are made to the project are added to the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/ruflin/Elastica/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).


Coding
------

These are the points to be discussed (just some examples below)

## Rules
* Changes are never pushed into master
* Pull requests are made to master
* We use the Forking Workflow. https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow

## Pull Requests
* Pull requests should be opened as early as possible as pull requests are also here for communication / discussing changes

Setup
-----
* Setup is fully in docker with docker-compose
* Make sure to run in the virtual environment
* No local setups
* Run tests locally
